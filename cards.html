                            <a class="card-link" href="assets/images/basic_island.png" target="_blank">Lands</a>
                            <p>Lands are the most common and basic type of card you are likely to come across. Lands represent
                                locations under the player's control, most of which have mana abilities. Because mana is needed
                                to use almost any card or ability, most decks need a high number of mana-producing lands
                                (typically between 33-50% of the total deck) to function effectively. Taking mana from the lands
                                represents the strands of magic and the most commonly printed Magic cards are the five basic
                                lands, one for each color, each of which intrinsically produces one mana of a specific color.
                            </p>

                            <a class="card-link" href="assets/images/griz_bear.jpg" target="_blank">Creatures</a>
                            <p>Creatures are summoned under the control of the casting player during a main phase and for the
                                first turn, they has what is commonly called "summoning sickness" until the beginning of its
                                controller's next turn. A creature with summoning sickness cannot attack or use an activated
                                ability with the tap or untap symbol in its cost, but it can block or use any other abilities it
                                has.</p>
        
                            <p>On the bottom-right corner of each creature card is that creature's power and toughness,
                                respectively. The power is the amount of damage a creature deals to an opponent or other
                                creatures in combat, and the toughness is the amount of damage a creature can survive. A
                                creature with damage equal to or greater than its toughness has "lethal damage," and is
                                destroyed. Similarly, a creature whose toughness is reduced to zero or less will go to its
                                owner's graveyard. Any damage a creature takes will accumulate until the end of the turn when
                                all damage is removed from all creatures.
                            </p>

                            <p>Sorceries are never put onto battlefield; instead, they take effect when their mana cost is paid
                                and the spell resolves. Sorceries share the timing restrictions as all permanent spell types,
                                that is, only be during the player's main phase, and only when nothing else is on the stack.</p>

                            <p>Sorceries are often one shot abilities that can either help you or hurt your opponents efforts to
                                gain advantage. Once they are used, they are put into the graveyard

                            <p>Instants are the only card type in Magic to have no timing restrictions. They can be played at
                                almost any time during the game, including during other player's turns and while another spell
                                or ability is waiting to resolve.</p>

                            <p>Instants, like Sorceries, are often one shot abilities that can either help you or hurt your
                                opponents efforts to gain advantage. Once they are used, they are put into the graveyard.

                            <p>Enchantments are a card type that represents persistent magical effects, usually remaining in
                                play indefinitely.</p>

                            <p>Most enchantments have continuous effects or triggered abilities, but some have abilities that
                                can be activated by their controllers. Occasionally, some creatures or other cards can also have
                                the sub-type enchantment, which means they are effected by cards that effect both.

                            <p>Artifacts are permanents that represent magical items, animated constructs, pieces of equipment,
                                or other objects and devices. Artifact, as a card type, is broader than the normal definition as
                                many other cards can also be a Magic “artifact” such as creatures or even lands. As with the
                                enchantment example, this means they can be effected by cards that effect both.

                            <p>Like the player, a planeswalker card represents a powerful being that can move from plane to
                                plane.</p>
    
                            <p>Planeswalkers have an intrinsic ability to enter the battlefield with a set number of loyalty
                                counters, printed in the lower right of the card. A planeswalker can be attacked, like a player,
                                or be damaged by an opponent's spell or ability. Any damage dealt to planeswalkers removes that
                                many loyalty counters and a planeswalker with no loyalty counters is put into the graveyard.</p>
    
                            <p>Planeswalkers typically have three abilities: one ability that adds loyalty counters as a cost
                                for a small benefit, one that removes a small number of counters as a cost for a larger effect,
                                and one that removes a large number of loyalty counters for a big effect. The last effect is
                                commonly referred to as the planeswalker's "ultimate" ability and usually leaves the opponent in
                                a devastated state. The starting loyalty of a planeswalker is commonly significantly lower than
                                the cost of its ultimate and a player has to build up the loyalty to access it.
