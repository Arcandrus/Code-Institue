				<h2 class="article-header">So you decided to play Magic: The Gathering?</h2>
				<br>
				<p>You've joined a community worldwide of enthusiatic players, collecters and content creators enjoying this strategic and fun TCG. Let's first learn some of the history of this storied card game.</p>

				<h3>What is Magic: The Gathering?</h3>
				<p>Magic: The Gathering (often abbreveated to MTG) is a trading card game - also known as a collectible card game - originally created by designer Richard Garfield and released by Wizards of the Coast in 1993. Widely considered the first trading card game, the game typically sees two players compete to defeat their opponent first by spending mana to play creatures, spells and other items and abilities.</p>
				<p>Players can customise their deck before each battle, choosing cards from their library and - depending on the format - the current legal pool of sets and expansions. More than 20,000 different cards have been	released for Magic: The Gathering since it first released more than 25 years ago, with over 20 billion cards printed between 2008 and 2016 alone.</p>
				<p>Some of MTG's most popular cards often see reprints in new sets, while other cards considered too powerful can be banned or restricted in certain formats to keep the game's competitive scene fair. The sets permitted for	tournament play in the Standard format periodically change to include only the four most recent sets released for the game, an action known as rotation. The sets allowed in other formats depend on the format itself. Of course, some of them aren't in games because they're prohibitively, ridiculously expensive.</p>

				<h3>Is Magic: The Gathering easy to learn?</h3>
				<p>Absolutely, anyone can get to grips with the basic rules after a few matches - not just strategy gamers!	MTG	has a range of starter sets both online and off that guide you through the game - starting with simple creatures and spells, before moving onto planeswalkers and more complex cards. It's very easy to learn how to play Magic:The Gathering, as you can start with simple pre-made card sets before advancing onto making your own deck.</p>
				<p>In addition, you can find places to play Magic: The Gathering via the official <a href="https://locator.wizards.com" target="_blank">Wizards of the Coast locator</a>, which tells you what shops are running events. Every week, Friday Night Magic is run in stores and other locations across the world.
				<p>These social events are a great way to enjoy the game socially, and also eke out the rules with more experienced players. Staff at the locations are often happy to help you out, perhaps even playing a few hands with you to get you orientated.
