			<h3>So, how do we actually play Magic: The Gathering?</h3>
			<p>Imagine you're the grand battle commander (stupid voice and hat optional), and your creatures are your
				frontline. Any monsters you have on the table can defend you, taking damage in your stead. As well as
				creature cards, you'll also have an array of spells, artefacts, enchantments and more. Everything is
				powered by land, a coloured energy, or mana, if you will.</p>
			<p>The aim of the game is to kill the other player(s). You each start with 20 health points, which are
				typically tracked using a 20-sided dice, though several other acceptable ways of tracking life total
				exist for example, companion apps and specially designed life counters.</p>

				how to get started playing MTG.</p>
